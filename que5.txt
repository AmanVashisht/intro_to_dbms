<!-- List out the different types of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth -->


Databases can be classified in a number of ways, depending on the criteria used. Some of the most common classification schemes include:

By data model Databases can be classified according to the data model they use to store and organize data. Common data models include:

Relational: Relational databases store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a different attribute of that record. Relational databases are the most common type of database today.

NoSQL: NoSQL databases are a newer type of database that is designed to store and manage non-relational data, such as JSON, XML, and graph data. NoSQL databases are often used for large datasets and high-performance applications.

Object-oriented: Object-oriented databases store data in objects, which are self-contained units that contain both data and code. Object-oriented databases are often used for complex data structures and applications that require a lot of data processing.


By deployment Databases can also be classified according to how they are deployed. Common deployment types include:

Centralized: Centralized databases are stored on a single server and accessed by users over a network. Centralized databases are typically the simplest type of database to deploy and manage.

Distributed: Distributed databases are stored across multiple servers and accessed by users over a network. Distributed databases are often used for large datasets and applications that require high availability.

Cloud-based: Cloud-based databases are hosted on a cloud computing platform, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. Cloud-based databases are often the most scalable and cost-effective type of database to deploy.
By purpose



Databases can also be classified according to their purpose. Some common database purposes include:

Transactional: Transactional databases are used to support applications that require high performance and data integrity, such as online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.

Analytical: Analytical databases are used to support applications that need to analyze large datasets, such as data warehouses and business intelligence (BI) systems.

Content management: Content management databases are used to store and manage digital content, such as images, videos, and documents.
